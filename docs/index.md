## Unheard City
  
This is an app that listens to Bluetooth Low Energy signals around it. These are broadcast by devices such as watches or fitness monitors and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

The app uses the Android BluetoothLE API to listen to the signals and the location of the phone. The data is written to a CSV file on the phone and it will need to be removed attaching the phone to a laptop or desktop. AndroidFileTransfer is a useful piece of software that helps with this on Macs. The app is limited to scanning every 5 seconds at the moment to minimise running the battery down.

The app is part of the Unheard City research project, itself part of the
Sampling [Sounds of the Future](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/research/sampling-sounds-of-the-future) project, funded by The University of Warwick Institute for Engagement and the [WIE City of Culture Programme](https://warwick.ac.uk/about/cityofculture/get-involved/programme/) and the Warwick-Monash Alliance Catalyst Project [Creating the Possible](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/research/creating-the-possible/).

The app is for Android only at the moment and the current version can be downloaded from this archive. The app is research software ad in need of further development.

The app requires access to Bluetooth and location permissions.
